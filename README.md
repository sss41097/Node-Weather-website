A weather web app developed using Node.js and Express.
Created a web app with a well defined user interface for the user to provide an address and then view its realtime weather forecast data.
Worked with Express to create the Node server.
Worked with Handlebars templating engine and Handlebars partials.
Set up the 404 page. Deployed the application on Heroku.
